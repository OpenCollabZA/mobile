# Synthesis Mobile

This project is used as a client for the Synthesis Service


## Requirements

Node 4.2 or higher, with cordova and bower installed

`(sudo) npm install -g cordova`

`(sudo) npm install -g gulp`

[Git client ](https://git-scm.com/downloads)


## Installation
`npm install`


## Usage
Once ready to run on a device or emulator:

`gulp build-android`

`gulp build-ios`

To use developer mode you need to set an environment variable
Unix:

`export DEVELOPMENT=true; gulp build-android`

Windows:

`set DEVELOPMENT=true; gulp build-android`

## Configuration

### Server connection
You might want to change the server the application is connecting too while developing (also when creating a fork)
To do this you need to edit `./buil.config.js`
You may use any nodejs tools you require to be able to export a config object

### Log Level
During development you might want to increase the log level.

See `src/scripts/base/SynthConfig.js` - logLevel

## Development environment
### Windows
[Register Device for Development](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/ff769508(v=vs.105).aspx)


## Development
### Source code
Content you will most often develop on, is in the `src` directory

Branding is located in the `branding` directory


## Build process technical info
The bulk of the build process is handled by a gulp script which is executed with a cordova hook on "before prepare"
This script takes care of compiling the less files, converting/combining/minifying javascript, and copying all the resources to the required location for cordova to take over.

The javascript files are writing with ES6 extentions. During the build process a babelify plugin is used to convert the files into standard ES5 commonjs files. Browserify is used to bundle these modules in a way that a website can use them.

When using development mode for your builds, you web inspector will use the sourcemaps to show you the paths to the original files (before the where converted).
